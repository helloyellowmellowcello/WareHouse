<strong>Description</strong><br />This is my Capstone Project submission, and is part of my personal portfolio.

<strong>About</strong><br /><br />
This repository contains my working files for one of the UI projects I've undertaken with the Codecademy Intensive Pro: Building UIs course. It is for obtaining suggestions, corrections and coding help from my course-mates and facilitator.<br /><br />
No reproduction of the HTML & CSS code outside of the abovementioned context is allowed. <br /><br />
While the basic bare-bones webpage content was produced by Codecademy, the majority of the styling and HTML structure and syntax have been modified by me with kind assistance from my course facilitator and instuctor, Jim Rosales (@KnightofCydonia).<br /><br />
Kindly approach Codecademy to obtain the base template.

<strong>The Brief</strong><br /><br />
Picture this scenario: You’ve been contracted by a large furniture store that recently completed a lengthy round of user testing on their current web site. With data in hand and a clear direction of what needs to be fixed, this company is seeking your design expertise to implement a handful of design fixes. The client has made it clear to you that your job is not to create or design new features, but merely fix the site that is currently in place.<br /><br />

Their reasoning: customers have stated the site works fairly well as is, but improving design aspects such as type sizes and hierarchy, consistent use of color, and the site’s general spacing and layout will improve the user experience tenfold.<br /><br />

Your client, WareHouse, is a large furniture retail store. According to their site data from last year, they get approximately 40% of their annual sales from their online web store. Moreover, this percentage has risen steady over the past several years and their internal analytics team is predicting in the next year that they will see about half - 50% - of their annual sales come from their website.<br /><br />

What’s the problem? Your client has not invested much time, resources or money into their web store. They built their website a few years ago and saw it as a potential secondary resource for sales. They never considered it could be equal or even better at generating and making sales than their physical locations. However, based on the data above, this assumption is not true. With that in mind, your client conducted a lengthy user research project to gain better insights into their website, its performance, and identify areas for improvement.<br /><br />

<strong>Tasks</strong><br /><br />
Part I - Involved a creation of a design proposal, and actionable tasks based on user stories.
Part II - Taking Part I's design proposal, we are to implement the UI improvements in a functioning website.
